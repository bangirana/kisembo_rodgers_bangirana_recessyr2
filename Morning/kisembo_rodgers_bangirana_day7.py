--description
Inheritance and method overriding allows a class(child class) to inherit attributes and methods
from another class (parent class).

Key concepts
Base class (parent class): Class whose properties are inherited by another class.
Derived class (child class): Class that inherits attributes and properties from another base class.

    """

# Example 1: Syntax Create a class where a dog inherits from animal and overrides with a speak method

print("Example 1")


class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof woof woof woof"


class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Barks"


# Implementatiion of inherited classes

animal = Animal()
dog = Dog()

print(animal.speak())
print(dog.speak())

# Polymorphism
# Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
# Method resolution Order (MRO). is order in which python looks for a method in hierarchy classes.

# Example 2: How polymorphismworks in python

Abstraction is used to hide implementation details

Abstract Class: A class that cannot be 
instantiated on its own and is meant to be subclassed.


Abstract classes can have one or more abstract methods. 
These methods do not have a body; they only have a signature.

Abstract Method: A method declared in an abstract class without an implementation.
Subclasses are required to provide an implementation for these methods.
